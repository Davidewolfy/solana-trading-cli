Overview
Solana Trading CLI functions as a unified control plane for Solana-based markets. It routes orders across multiple DEXs, preserving best-execution approaches while maintaining low latency and high reliability. Real-time streaming streams market data and account events directly to the CLI, enabling near-instant decision loops. ML strategies can be trained, tested, and deployed within the same toolchain, allowing data-driven decisions to adapt to market regimes. The autonomous architecture search (ASI-Arch) module analyzes live trading patterns and system constraints to propose architecture changes that enhance throughput, reduce latency, or improve risk controls. This combination yields a cohesive, scalable, and intelligent trading system suitable for production environments.

Why Solana Trading CLI
- Unified routing across multiple DEXs: You no longer need bespoke scripts for every exchange. The routing layer selects the best price, liquidity, and slippage profile, then dispatches orders to the optimal venue.
- Real-time data and streaming: Market data, order book updates, and trades flow through a low-latency stream, enabling fast reaction to market shifts.
- ML-driven strategies: Build, evaluate, and run ML-based trading approaches that adapt to evolving conditions. Re-train, validate, and deploy strategies with confidence.
- Autonomous architecture search: ASI-Arch continuously analyzes performance, resource usage, and risk metrics to suggest architecture improvements. This helps you stay ahead as workloads scale.
- Production-ready stance: The system is designed for reliability, observability, and maintainability. It ships with tests, CI, containerization, and clear operational guides.

Core Concepts
- Unified DEX Routing: A routing layer sits between strategy logic and each DEX client. It abstracts exchange specifics and provides a consistent API for price discovery, liquidity checks, and order placement.
- Real-Time Streaming: A streaming bus propagates updates from Solana programs, DEX events, and market feeds. Consumers can subscribe to topics like order book depth, trade feeds, and account notifications.
- ML Strategies: A library of model templates and feature extractors. It supports offline backtesting and live inference with safeguards. Models can be swapped or layered into strategy pipelines.
- ASI-Arch (Autonomous Architecture Search): A lightweight agent runs optimization tasks on the deployment plane. It considers latency, throughput, resilience, and cost to propose alternative architectures and config changes.
- Modularity: The system uses clean boundaries between core engine, data adapters, strategy modules, and orchestration. You can replace or extend components with minimal friction.

Architecture and Design
- Core Engine (Rust): The heart of the system. It provides deterministic, low-latency processing for order routing, event handling, and risk checks. It also orchestrates the streaming and execution pipelines.
- CLI and Tooling Layer (TypeScript/Node): Scripting and tooling around the core engine. It provides configuration, workflow automation, and user-facing commands. It also exposes utilities for testing and simulation.
- Data Adapters: Connectors for Solana RPC, DEX APIs, and data feeds. They normalize data into common formats used by routing, strategies, and analytics modules.
- Routing Module: The unified path from strategy outputs to exchange-specific execution. It encapsulates API calls, slippage models, and timing constraints.
- Strategy Library: A set of ready-to-run ML-based strategies, plus a framework for custom models. It includes feature builders, normalization steps, and evaluation metrics.
- Observability: Logging, metrics, traces, and dashboards. The system exports standard formats for Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and log aggregators.
- ASI-Arch Engine: A separate optimizer that runs ongoing experiments. It suggests architectural changes, new components, or tuning knobs to improve the overall system.

    - Solana RPC endpoints
    - DEX endpoints or adapters
    - Account keys and permissions
    - Streaming topics to subscribe to
    - Routing preferences and risk thresholds
  - Example minimal config sections:
    - solana_rpc: https://api.devnet.solana.com
    - dex_adapters:
        - name: serum
          enabled: true
        - name: raydium
          enabled: true
    - accounts:
        - keypair: /path/to/your/keypair.json
    - streaming:
        - enable: true
        - topics: ["order_book", "trades", "balances"]
- Start the system
  - Run the core engine with your config:
    - cargo run --release -- --config config.yaml
  - Or start the CLI tooling, if you prefer scripting:
    - npm run start -- --config config.yaml
- Validate a simple workflow
  - Verify streaming topics produce updates in real time.
  - Issue a mock or paper trade in a safe environment to validate routing to multiple DEXs.
  - Observe the routing decisions and confirm that best-price and best-liquidity criteria are being respected.

DEX Routing and Real-Time Streaming
Unified Multi-DEX Routing
- The routing layer abstracts away exchange-specific details. It presents a single API to the strategy, including:
  - Price discovery: get_best_price and get_mid_price across DEXs.
  - Liquidity checks: available_liquidity and depth estimates.
  - Execution: place_order with control over time-in-force, slippage, and post-trade risk checks.
- Routing strategies
  - Market-aware routing: prioritize best price with liquidity constraints.
  - Time-aware routing: factor in latency to avoid stale quotes.
  - Risk-adjusted routing: apply position sizing and exposure limits during routing.
- Extensibility
  - Add new DEX adapters through a clean plugin interface.
  - Each adapter implements a small, stable contract to the routing engine, keeping the core logic simple and maintainable.

Real-Time Streaming
- Data streams
  - Market data: order books, recent trades, price feeds, imbalances.
  - Account streams: fills, cancellations, and margin updates.
  - System events: health checks, alerts, and ASI-Arch suggestions.
- Consumers
  - Strategy modules subscribe to relevant topics.
  - Analytics dashboards observe live metrics.
  - Operational scripts monitor health and auto-recover from transient faults.
- Reliability
  - Backpressure handling and non-blocking I/O ensure smooth behavior under load.
  - Replay capability for streams in the event of a restart, preserving state where feasible.

ML Strategies and Training
- Strategy templates
  - Momentum, mean-reversion, breakout, and arbitrage-inspired templates.
  - Each template defines input features, target labels, and risk controls.
- Feature engineering
  - Feature builders compute indicators such as moving averages, volatility, order-flow imbalances, and liquidity metrics.
  - Features are normalized and cached for efficient inference.
- Offline training and backtesting
  - A sandboxed environment runs historical data through an ML pipeline.
  - Backtests report key metrics: Sharpe, drawdown, win rate, and turnover.
- Live inference
  - Lightweight models run on streaming data with low latency.
  - Guardrails prevent unexpected model behavior. If a model behaves anomalously, the system can pause trading for safety.
- Model governance
  - Versioned models and clear deployment steps.
  - Rollback capability if new models underperform or misbehave.

Autonomous Architecture Search (ASI-Arch)
- Why ASI-Arch
  - Markets change, workloads shift, and hardware evolves. ASI-Arch helps the system adapt without manual rewrites.
- How it works
  - The agent monitors metrics like latency, throughput, error rates, and resource usage.
  - It runs lightweight experiments to test alternative configurations and architectures.
  - It suggests changes, such as rebalancing components, introducing caching, or switching to a different data adapter implementation.
- Safety and governance
  - Changes proposed by ASI-Arch require human approval before deployment in production.
  - Every proposal is tested in a staging environment with synthetic workloads before rollout.
- Outputs
  - Suggested topology changes, parameter tweaks, and monitoring enhancements.
  - A clear changelog of what was evaluated and what was adopted.
